# Project Title

Job Market Analysis Using Python and Forecasting Models




## Description
This project provides a comprehensive step-by-step analysis of the job market data, focusing on trends, forecasting, and insights related to AI and tech job trends. It is designed as a learning resource to walk through the full data analytics workflow using Python.
## Overview
The notebook covers the entire data analysis lifecycle including:

 1. Loading and cleaning job market data

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 3. Time-series aggregation and visualization of job posting counts

 4. Seasonal decomposition of weekly time-series data

 5. Forecasting future job trends using SARIMAX statistical model and RandomForest machine learning

 6. Exporting cleaned and aggregated data for use in Power BI dashboards
 
## How to Use
 1. Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.

 2. Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom.

 3. Each section includes explanations before code to guide users.

 4. Update file paths as needed to match your local environment.
## Key Libraries
 1. pandas, numpy for data handling

 2. matplotlib for plotting

 3. sklearn (RandomForestRegressor and metrics) for machine learning forecasting
